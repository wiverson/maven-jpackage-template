# Note that the builds produced by this build WILL NOT RUN on macOS Monterey!
# They will be flagged as unsigned and quarantined. You can run a command-line
# to un-quarantine them, but obviously that's not practical for end-users.
# Instead, you will need to set up the signing and notarization to get this to work
# seamlessly for users. See the notes on signing linked to in the README.md
# in the root of this directory.
